To Do
- update preprocessFile in /example
- analyze lateral Bubble motion 3D
- use shear rate in main.cc
- number of time steps for fully developed shear flow
- check for static shear state

Done
- fix numOfthreads in all cases
- fixed cut-out 3D
- write proper CSV files
- update makefile for /translate
- analyze bubble position 2D / 3D
- analyze lateral Bubble motion 2D
- C++11 in anderen Makefiles hinzuf√ºgen
- find indices of bubble Cells 
- cut and paste Cells from one Lattice to another 
- process warnings
- enable shear flow in Preprocessfile (shear rate)
- correct DimSet to int arrays
